I played around with [8base](https://www.8base.com/) today.

It basically allows you to design a database and automatically generates a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API for it.

It's very very cool, and takes care of a lot of things for you (e.g: login).

The free account is somewhat limeted though, which makes sense.

I created some models and instances and was pleasently surprised with it.

I also used a [boilerplate VueJS app](https://github.com/8base/vue-8base-starter-app) to test it.
