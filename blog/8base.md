# Intro

I ran across [8base](https://www.8base.com/) today.

It's basically a platform where you can design a database and get an automatically generated [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API for it.

It's very very cool, and takes care of a lot of things for you (e.g: [login](https://docs.8base.com/docs/8base-console/authentication/)).

The free account is somewhat limeted though, which makes sense.

I played around with it, creating some models and instances, and was pleasently surprised.

I also used a [boilerplate VueJS app](https://github.com/8base/vue-8base-starter-app) to test it.
