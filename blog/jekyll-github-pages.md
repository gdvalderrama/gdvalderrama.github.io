excerpt: Setup this site.

I found out Jekyll could be used for static github pages.

I then proceded to forget all about it.

I probably followed [this guide to set it up](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).

## UPDATE

Then a lot later I realized I was not happy with my Jekyll blog as my main GitHub page and proceded to destroy it and replace it with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/docs/deploy-to-github/).
